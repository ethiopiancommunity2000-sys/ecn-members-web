## 🏃 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- SQL Server (or SQL Server Express)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the project root:
```bash
cd CSharpReactProject
```

2. Update the connection string in `API/appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ECNMembersConnection": "Your SQL Server connection string"
  },
  "TokenKey": "Your secret key for JWT (at least 32 characters)"
}
```

3. Run database migrations:
```bash
cd API
dotnet ef database update --project ../Persistence
```

4. Run the API:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client app:
```bash
cd clinet-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file (if not exists):
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5000/api
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔐 Authentication
